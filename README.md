# Mobile-Clinic-App-Test-Added-

The Mobile Clinic App, as one of Th HEalth Foundation's Leading Projects
This mobile app was developed in Kotlin and Java using Android Studio by 
2 College students, Cibrian Hofsta and Gareth Prinsloo

Purpose: The robust app serves as a digitalised extention of the reworked website
         where volunteering employees from the Health Foundation will be dispatched 
         semi-anually to nearby local schools where they then use the app to 
         record general health screening and procedure info of students
